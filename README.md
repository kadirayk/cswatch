# CS Watch

"it's midnight, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until the next day. 
I shall have no cups of tea, write no code, have no break. 
I shall have no rest even for weekend. I shall watch for allerts and solve problems. 
I am the sword in the darkness. I am the CI/CD pipeline with flesh and bones. 
I am the shield that guards the realms of application servers. 
I pledge my life and honor to the CS Watch, for this 24 hours and all the 24 hours to come."
